## Project Overview
This is a modern Next.js React website for "The Seasons Roleplay" FiveM RP server. The design focuses on:

- **Glass morphism effects** and liquid/fluid design elements
- **Modern animations** using Framer Motion
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS
- **Sleek UI components** inspired by React Bits
- **Dark theme** with purple/blue gradient accents

## Design Principles
- Use glass morphism effects (`glass` and `glass-dark` CSS classes)
- Implement smooth animations and transitions
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Follow the existing color scheme (purple, blue, dark background)
- Ensure components are responsive and accessible

## Technology Stack
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Lucide React** for icons

## Component Structure
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Use the `ui/` folder for base components (Button, GlassCard, etc.)
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- Use motion components for animations

## Styling Guidelines
- Use the predefined CSS custom properties and classes
- Follow the glass morphism design pattern
- Maintain the gradient text effect for headings
- Use consistent hover effects and transitions
